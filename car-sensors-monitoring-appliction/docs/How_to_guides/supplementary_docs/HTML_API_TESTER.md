## HTML API Tester

You can test the API endpoints using the included HTML file, accessible at `http://localhost:3000/tester`. The HTML tester provides forms for interacting with the following API functions:

- `Create Car Sensor Data`: Adds a new car model with specified year, sensor type, and sensor value.
- `Retrieve All Car Sensor Data`: Fetches all stored car sensor data.
- `Retrieve Car Sensor Data by ID`: Fetches car data by its unique ID.
- `Update Car Sensor Data`: Updates the sensor value for an existing car by ID.
- `Delete Car Sensor Data`: Deletes car data from the database by ID.

Each action's response will be displayed on the page in a dedicated response section for easy debugging and API testing.
